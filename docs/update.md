# FAIRe News & Updates
We are continuously working to enhance the FAIRe guidelines. Check this page regularly to see the latest updates, new developments, and ongoing activities!

## TDWG/GSC collaboration
2025-11-13
In early 2025, we established the TDWG and GSC eDNA task groups with both original and new FAIRe members. Our goal is to develop eDNA checklists in Darwin Core (DwC) and MIxS under the TDWG and GSC frameworks. 
This effort is key to bridging FAIRe with  established databases, such as GBIF, OBIS, and INSDC, which predominantly use DwC and MIxS standards. 
For detailed information about our goals, please visit the task group webpages: [TDWG](https://www.tdwg.org/community/gbwg/enviro/) and [GSC](https://www.gensc.org/pages/projects/eDNA-project.html) 

## FAIRe Coding
2025-11-13
We are excited to announce the formation of the FAIRe Coding Working Group, focused on developing FAIRe scripts and tools.  
The group includes members experienced in coding and passionate about FAIR principles. Our aim is to create scripts and tools that help the community adopt FAIRe guidelines in their workflows, automate data formatting, mapping, and submissions, and facilitate broader adoption of FAIRe practices.  
We plan to develop these tools in both **R** and **Python** as part of a new package.
